# Identity Reconciliation Service

This is my solution for the Bitespeed Identity Reconciliation backend task. Itâ€™s built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma, and PostgreSQL.

## Deployment

[https://identity-reconciliation-w2rr.onrender.com/api/identify](https://identity-reconciliation-w2rr.onrender.com/api/identify)- This service is currently down as I hit free limit of Render                 
[https://identity-reconciliation-ta37.onrender.com/api/identify](https://identity-reconciliation-ta37.onrender.com/api/identify)- Use this for now sorry for the inconvenience caused

## Features

* Handles customer identity linking via email and/or phone number.
* Maintains a primary contact and links secondary contacts.
* Prevents duplicate entries and merges multiple primaries if needed.
* Uses BFS to always find and link to the root primary.

## Tech Stack

* Node.js + Express
* TypeScript
* Prisma ORM
* PostgreSQL (I recommend Neon for dev)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repo and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Set your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` (I used Neon, but any Postgres works).
3. Run migrations and generate Prisma client:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   npx prisma generate
   ```
4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Postman Collection

A Postman collection is included in the repo: `Identity_Reconsilation.postman_collection.json` for testing the API endpoints.
